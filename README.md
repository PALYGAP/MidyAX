Software for the MidyAX
------------------------

The MidyAX project is aimed at building a tool for the AXE-FX that makes it possible to use the BCR2000 unit to pilot the AXE-FX. It gives easier access to all the parameters of the AXE-FX and allows to more easily adjust the sound of the AMPs and all the effects inside the AXE-FX. The MidyAX aims at allowing the AXE-FX users to more easily tap into the full potential of this incredible unit that the AXE-FX is.


This software is brooken into two main parts :

    - one that runs an an ARDUINO MEGA 128    ----> "THE MidyAX  for ARDUINO MEGA" folder
    - one that runs on uVGA-III display adpter from 4D systems    ----> "uVGA" folder

The current version is still under construction but worked pretty well for all the features it currently provides.
Some parts of the code are not perfects but I am working on improving it and making it more readable. Quite a bit of it was written between 3am and 8am since I was (and am) working on it before going to work. Keep in mind that the code was concieved and written while building a "proof-of-concept" prototype while I was learning about the ARDUINO environment and getting back into programming. So yes sometime not perfect.

I hope that the code can be useful to other people.
