Software for the MidyAX


The MidyAX project is aimed at building a tool for the AXE-FX that makes it possible to use the BCR2000 unit to pilot the AXE-FX.

It gives easier access to all the parameters of the AXE-FX and allows to more easily adjust the sound of the AMPs and all the effects. 

The MidyAX aims at allowing the AXE-FX users to more easily tap into the full potential of this incredible unit that the AXE-FX is.
